## Getting started

When developing/testing this module locally you will need to use the mobile app. In the future we will create the ability to test directly from this repo.

### Steps For Testing Locally

1. Open the main app and run it.
2. In this repo, run the command `npm run test-locally` after updating the path to point to the main app. This will start up a script that watches for changes and will automatically apply them to main app.
